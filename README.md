This application aims to be able to remotely manage cameras that do not have wifi support or cannot connect to the Internet.

There are 2 features of the current application, but will be increased later.
1) Take the photo and save it to the camera.
2) Take the photo and save it to the phone.

In order for the cameras to be managed remotely, a computer with a linux-based computer should be used with libgphoto2 library.Like a Raspberry Pi.
